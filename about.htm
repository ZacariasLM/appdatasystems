A Medical Solutions Company<br>

</span>


In 2009, the U.S. Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.  Its purpose is to promote the meaningful use of technology in healthcare so that technology ultimately results in improved healthcare for the patient.  Most healthcare providers today are moving or have already moved from paper-based charts to electronic charts.  Also, due to changing economic conditions and regulatory oversight many providers have difficulty balancing their time between the care of their patients and the efficient management of their practice.  App Data Systems provides a full practice analysis to identify hidden losses that often drain time and profitability.  After careful review by our analysts and IT architects, a list of problems and expert solutions is shared with the practice.  We have a proven track record of building profitability for small and large practices.<br>

History<br>

</span>

In 1989, we built our first Medical Claims software application for Paragon Ambulance company in Detroit, Michigan.  We sold this software to medical providers until the mid 90â€™s. We moved from development into consulting and managed major health IT projects including the National Spinal Cord Registry for the VA Hospital which was their first system to incorporate Java and graphical user interfaces with VISTA.  We also managed the Health Information Exchange (HIE) and meaningful use attestation for Adventist Health,  as well as integration of Cerner with many other EMRs including NextGen, Epic, McKesson, eClinical Works, and others.  We also managed the Integration program for the Stryker Instruments acquisition of the Neurovascular Division of Boston Scientific.  We now offer a solid mix of certified EMR, Practice Management, Cloud Storage and custom IT solutions.<br>

Future Goals<br>

</span>

From the beginning, our team was involved with helping healthcare practices to understand the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities that the HITECH Act presents.  We will continue to track and remain abreast of new and changing regulations in the healthcare industry.  We will also continue to build strategic partnerships with best of the breed EMR and billing software makers and will continue to offer discounted pricing and expert support to medical practices looking to streamline, achieve meaningful use  or improve profitability.<br>
